# Facial Emotion Detection

## Overview

Facial Emotion Detection is a machine learning project aimed at identifying and classifying human emotions from facial expressions in images or video streams. This project leverages deep learning techniques to build and train models that can accurately detect emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and neutral.

## Features

- Real-time emotion detection from webcam feed
- Emotion classification from static images
- Pre-trained deep learning models for emotion detection
- High accuracy and performance
- Easy-to-use interface
  
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bhavikamaini20/facial-emotion-detection.git
   cd facial-emotion-detection
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```



## Usage

### Real-time Emotion Detection

To run real-time emotion detection from your webcam:

```sh
python real_time_emotion_detection.py
```

### Emotion Detection from Images

To detect emotions in a static image:

```sh
python image_emotion_detection.py --image path_to_image.jpg
```

### Command-line Arguments

- `--image`: Path to the input image file for emotion detection.

## Model Training

To train the emotion detection model from scratch, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset (see [Datasets](#datasets)).
2. Run the training script:

   ```sh
   python train_model.py --dataset path_to_dataset --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
   ```

### Command-line Arguments

- `--dataset`: Path to the dataset directory.
- `--epochs`: Number of training epochs.
- `--batch_size`: Batch size for training.

## Datasets

The project can use any publicly available facial emotion datasets. Some popular options include:

- [FER-2013](https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/fer2013)
- [CK+](https://www.jeffcohn.net/Resources/)

Ensure that your dataset is properly formatted and organized before training the model.
